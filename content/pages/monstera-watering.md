**Water every 1-2 weeks, allowing soil to dry out between waterings.**  
Expect to water more often in brighter light and less often in lower light.  

#### Autumn & Winter
Keep soil barely moist - water once every three weeks.
Do not feed plant.

#### Spring & Summer
Water every 1-2 weeks, allowing soil to dry out between waterings.
Feed plant once a month.

> **Pro tip:**  
> Monsteras can benefit from filtered water or water left out overnight before using.

## Drainage

Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy potting mix. 
Yellow leaves are usually a sign of overwatering.
